  <h1 class="post-title">Five reasons sysadmins should use Git</h1>
  <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2012</span>
  <p>This post could also be called “Things we could learn from our developer brethren, but I digress, to the list! (Lists are awesome, aren’t they?)</p>

<p>I’m not going to try and tell you how to get started with Git (<a href="http://glarizza.posterous.com/using-git-for-mac-sysadmins-part-1">go here instead for that</a>), I’m merely going to get on my soapbox.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Branches</strong> - need to test something? No need to spend all day making a test setup, just make a branch and clone it to the test server. If it turns out that I wasn’t mad and my changes were a good idea, they can be merged back into the main branch just as easily.</li>
  <li><strong>Accountability</strong> - who made that strange config change? A quick look at the commit history is all you need.</li>
  <li><strong>Diff</strong> - what actually changed? It’s easy to see the exact changes</li>
  <li><strong>Change history</strong> - why was that random change even made? Hopefully it’s in the commit message! (Your commit messages are useful, aren’t they?!)</li>
  <li><strong>You can be a nice sysadmin</strong> - if you use GitHub it’s simple to take your repo public and share your awesomeness.</li>
</ol>

<p>So there you go - I hope this goes some way to answering the question “why shuold I be using Git?”</p>
