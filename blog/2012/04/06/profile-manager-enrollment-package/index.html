  <h1 class="post-title">Profile Manager Enrollment Package</h1>
  <span class="post-date">06 Apr 2012</span>
  <p>Over the past week or so, we had a need to enroll macs automagically with a Lion Profile Manager server. My first plan was to do what Charles Edge did in his recent <a href="http://krypted.com/mac-os-x/automating-profile-manager-enrollment-through-deploystudio/">blog post</a> and use DeployStudio. Then I remembered another post by Charles on <a href="http://krypted.com/iphone/profile-manager-and-profiles/">/usr/bin/profiles</a> and wondered if I could make a workflow that can be used throughout our deployment and system maintenance process - yup, the humble pkg, that can be popped into Munki for existing macs, installed with DeployStudio for imaging and pushed out with ARD if need be.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Profile-Manager-Enrollment">Get the code from GitHub</a></p>

<p>Assuming you’ve got <a href="https://github.com/unixorn/luggage">The Luggage</a> set up, first off you’ll need your enrollment and trust profiles:

1.	Create a new enrollment profile
2. Give your enrollement profile a name
3. Download the trust profile
4. Download the enrollment profile</p>

<p>If your attachments auto open, click cancel when you’re asked if you want to install the profiles so they stay in ~/Downloads. Rename them to enroll.mobileconfig and trust.mobileconfig and pop them into the directory you cloned from GitHub. A quick <code>make pkg</code> and you’ve got your package.</p>
