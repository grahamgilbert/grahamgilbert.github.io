    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A massive thanks to everyone who came to my talk today, and thanks to everyone who helped out with the Q&amp;A at the end. All of the code I used in the talk is <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/automate_psu_2014">up on GitHub</a> and <a href="http://grahamgilbert.com/images/posts/2014-07-10/Automate_yourself_out_of_a_job.pdf">here are the slides</a>. Hopefully the video will convey how much fun it actually was &ndash; it could have been a disaster, so I&rsquo;m hugely grateful to everyone who contributed to the discussion at the end.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for everyone that came to my talk today, it was fun to finally show off what I&rsquo;ve been working on for the last year or so. I&rsquo;m sure the video will be up soon, but in the meantime, <a href="http://grahamgilbert.com/images/posts/2014-07-09/Multi_site_Munki.pdf">here are the slides from the talk</a>.</p>
