    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past week or so, we had a need to enroll macs automagically with a Lion Profile Manager server. My first plan was to do what Charles Edge did in his recent <a href="http://krypted.com/mac-os-x/automating-profile-manager-enrollment-through-deploystudio/">blog post</a> and use DeployStudio. Then I remembered another post by Charles on <a href="http://krypted.com/iphone/profile-manager-and-profiles/">/usr/bin/profiles</a> and wondered if I could make a workflow that can be used throughout our deployment and system maintenance process &ndash; yup, the humble pkg, that can be popped into Munki for existing macs, installed with DeployStudio for imaging and pushed out with ARD if need be.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Profile-Manager-Enrollment">Get the code from GitHub</a></p>

<p>Assuming you&rsquo;ve got <a href="https://github.com/unixorn/luggage">The Luggage</a> set up, first off you&rsquo;ll need your enrollment and trust profiles:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new enrollment profile</li>
<li>Give your enrollement profile a name</li>
<li>Download the trust profile</li>
<li>Download the enrollment profile</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="/images/posts/2012-04-06/profile_enrollment_and_trust-full.jpg"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2012-04-06/profile_enrollment_and_trust-thumb.jpg"></a></p>

<p>If your attachments auto open, click cancel when you&rsquo;re asked if you want to install the profiles so they stay in ~/Downloads. Rename them to enroll.mobileconfig and trust.mobileconfig and pop them into the directory you cloned from GitHub. A quick <code>make pkg</code> and you&rsquo;ve got your package.</p>
