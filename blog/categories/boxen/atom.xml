    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you might know, I&rsquo;m a bit of a fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqerWmKU1Js">Munki and Puppet</a> for managing the Macs I look after. Around a year ago, I really wanted to be able to automate my own setup across my own Macs the same way. I was forever finding that the particular git repository or app wasn&rsquo;t on the Mac I was working on. Then there came the time when I wanted to do a clean install &ndash; that was easily a day down the drain there!</p>

<h2>Automate all of the things</h2>

<p>Then <a href="https://boxen.github.com/">Boxen</a> was released &ndash; based on Puppet, but targeted at setting up individual&rsquo;s machines. I got on board just over a year ago, and haven&rsquo;t really looked back &ndash; manually installing an app on my Mac seems very strange now. I&rsquo;m not going to cover how to get started with Boxen, as there are <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=getting+started+with+Boxen">many getting started guides out there</a> (however, <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2013/02/15/puppet-plus-github-equals-laptop-love/">Gary Larizza&rsquo;s</a> is rather good).</p>

<p>There will come a time when you need to update the core part of Boxen. This happened to me when I clean installed 10.9 on my work laptop &ndash; all kinds of shit broke (somehow it managed to survive the upgrade process &ndash; go figure). I looked around, but couldn&rsquo;t really find a definitive guide, so here it is (it&rsquo;s shorter than this piece of rambling).</p>

<h2>Ok, stop talking</h2>

<p>As Boxen is made by GitHub, updating it is much like updating any other project on there that you&rsquo;ve made a fork of.  First we&rsquo;re going to add it as a remote repository:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ cd ~/src/our-boxen
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen.git
</code></p>

<p>Then we&rsquo;re going to fetch the stuff from the upstream repository:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ git fetch upstream
</code>
Now we&rsquo;re going to merge the updated repository with our own:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ git checkout master
$ git merge upstream/master
</code></p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t modified any of the core Boxen files (<code>Puppetfile</code>, <code>Gemfile</code> or <code>manifests/site.pp</code> in my case), you might get away without having to fix any conflicts (you can ignore any in <code>Puppetfile.lock</code> and <code>Gemfile.lock</code>, we&rsquo;ll deal with those next). I had conflicts as I had previously:</p>

<ul>
<li>Been stupid and tried to update Boxen by just changing the Puppet Module and Gem versions</li>
<li>Edited <code>site.pp</code> as I didn&rsquo;t want Nginx or node.js installed</li>
<li>Been dumb and put my custom Puppet modules in the wrong place in my <code>Puppetfile</code></li>
</ul>


<p>None of these were particularly arduous to fix, but annoying none the less. If you find you have loads, you might want to run:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ git mergetool
</code></p>

<p>The next step is to update your Puppet modules and RubyGems. First delete <code>Puppetfile.lock</code> and <code>Gemfile.lock</code>. Now go back to your trusty Terminal and:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ bundle install --without development
$ bundle exec librarian-puppet install --clean
</code></p>

<p>At this point, you might want to go through the custom modules you&rsquo;ve added to your <code>Puppetfile</code> and update those, although this is by no means required &ndash; some apps I&rsquo;ve installed through Boxen don&rsquo;t have a built in updater, so Boxen is more convenient than hunting for installers on various vendor&rsquo;s websites. Once your modules are up to date in your <code>Puppetfile</code>,  you&rsquo;re done! You can now get your Mac back to how you like it by issuing the usual:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ boxen
</code></p>
