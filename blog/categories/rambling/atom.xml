    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post could also be called &ldquo;Things we could learn from our developer brethren, but I digress, to the list! (Lists are awesome, aren&rsquo;t they?)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to try and tell you how to get started with Git (<a href="http://glarizza.posterous.com/using-git-for-mac-sysadmins-part-1">go here instead for that</a>), I&rsquo;m merely going to get on my soapbox.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Branches</strong> &ndash; need to test something? No need to spend all day making a test setup, just make a branch and clone it to the test server. If it turns out that I wasn&rsquo;t mad and my changes were a good idea, they can be merged back into the main branch just as easily.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability</strong> &ndash; who made that strange config change? A quick look at the commit history is all you need.</li>
<li><strong>Diff</strong> &ndash; what actually changed? It&rsquo;s easy to see the exact changes</li>
<li><strong>Change history</strong> &ndash; why was that random change even made? Hopefully it&rsquo;s in the commit message! (Your commit messages are useful, aren&rsquo;t they?!)</li>
<li><strong>You can be a nice sysadmin</strong> &ndash; if you use GitHub it&rsquo;s simple to take your repo public and share your awesomeness.</li>
</ol>


<p>So there you go &ndash; I hope this goes some way to answering the question &ldquo;why shuold I be using Git?&rdquo;</p>
