    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As previously mentioned, Sal now has an <a href="https://github.com/salopensource/sal/blob/master/docs/API.md">API</a>. You might be wondering what you can do with this wonderous API. This is a simple example of using it to automate building packages to enrol Macs into Sal.</p>

<p>The basic workflow of this script is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the API to get a list of all Machine Groups in Sal &ndash; this will return JSON (a markup language that is easily parsable with languages like Python)</li>
<li>Download the Sal postflight scripts</li>
<li>Download the latest Facter installer</li>
<li>For each machine group, build a package that will install all of the packages and then set the correct Sal preferences.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/grahamgilbert/8ccba318d3ecadee02b1">You can find the script in this Gist</a>. I&rsquo;m not going to go through the script line by line, but we&rsquo;ll cover how to configure it.</p>

<p>First off you will need an API key configuring. Log into Sal as a user with Global Admin privelages and choose the &lsquo;person&rsquo; menu at the top right and then choose Settings. From the sidebar, choose API keys and then choose to make a new one. Give it a name so you can recognise it &ndash; I called this one &ldquo;PKG Generator&rdquo;. You will then be given a public key and a private key. Make a note of them, we&rsquo;ll need them in the next section.</p>

<h2>Configuring the script</h2>

<p>Edit the variables at the top to match your environment:</p>

<p>``` python</p>

<h1>No trailing slash on this one &ndash; I was lazy and didn&rsquo;t check for it</h1>

<p>SAL_URL = &ldquo;<a href="https://sal.yourcompany.com">https://sal.yourcompany.com</a>&rdquo;
PUBLIC_KEY = &ldquo;yourpublickeyhere&rdquo;
PRIVATE_KEY = &ldquo;yourreallyreallyreallylongprivatekeyhere&rdquo;
PKG_IDENTIFIER = &ldquo;com.yourcompany.sal_enrol&rdquo;
SAL_PKG = &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/salopensource/sal/releases/download/v0.4.0/sal_scripts.pkg">https://github.com/salopensource/sal/releases/download/v0.4.0/sal_scripts.pkg</a>&rdquo;
FACTER_PKG = &ldquo;<a href="https://downloads.puppetlabs.com/mac/facter-latest.dmg">https://downloads.puppetlabs.com/mac/facter-latest.dmg</a>&rdquo;</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>There are some caveats with this script:</p>

<ul>
<li>It will spit the packages out in your current directory. Make sure you&rsquo;ve <code>cd</code>-ed into where you want the packages to be generated.</li>
<li>It uses <code>urllib2</code> to request the information from Sal and to download the packages &ndash; this means that there is no verification of the SSL certificates, so make sure you know where you&rsquo;re connecting to.</li>
</ul>


<p>All ready to run it?</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo python sal_package_generator.py
</code></p>

<p>And you&rsquo;ll get a directory full of packages that will get your fleet reporting into Sal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been working with some other Mac admins on a new application that can aid with the deployment of Macs &ndash; say hi to <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr">Imagr</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2015-05-08/Imagr.png"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not intended to be a full replacement for Deploystudio, but it&rsquo;s now got all of the features I need to use Imagr full time. If you&rsquo;d like to get started with Imagr, head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr/wiki/Getting-Started">Wiki</a> &ndash; the only requirement is a web server, so the barrier to entry is pretty low (if you followed my guide on how to set up <a href="/blog/2015/04/22/getting-started-with-bsdpy-on-docker/">BSDPy</a>, you can use that web server).</p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll give it a go and maybe, just maybe, we can get rid of those little Mac Minis for good!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last time we saw our heroes, there was the unfuffilled promise of making small NetInstall sets. Now is the time to deliver on that promise. We&rsquo;re going to make a small NetInstall that will open up Terminal.app.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve not read the <a href="http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2015/04/12/building-custom-netinstalls-with-autonbi/">previous post</a> (and have got AutoNBI), go and do it now. I&rsquo;ll wait. All done? <!--more--></p>

<h2>Previously on 24</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2015-04-13/jack.gif"></p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous post, we&rsquo;re aiming to have a small NetInstall set. Once you&rsquo;ve made your NetInstall, open up <code>NetInstall.dmg</code> &ndash; you&rsquo;ll see a <code>Packages</code> directory. This is where the majority of the bulk in a NetInstall lives &ndash; the packages it actually installs. There is also a hidden <code>BaseSystem.dmg</code> which is what will load when your NetBoot the machine.</p>

<h2>I&rsquo;m bored, can we make something please?</h2>

<p>As I mentioned above, we&rsquo;re going to make a simple NetInstall that will open up a Terminal window. To do that, we&rsquo;re going to leverage something that Apple kindly left in the image for us &ndash; <code>rc.imaging</code>. A bit of background &ndash; in <code>/etc</code> you&rsquo;ll find a series of <code>rc.*</code> files. One of those in a NetInstall is <code>rc.install</code>, which will look for an <code>rc.imaging</code> file in a few places &ndash; one of those is <code>/System/Installation/Packages/Extras</code> &ndash; conveniently a location that Pepijn has made AutoNBI able to work with.</p>

<p>Somewhere on your Mac, make a directory called <code>Packages</code> and then inside that, make a directory called <code>Extras</code>. Inside that directory we&rsquo;re going to create a file called <code>rc.imaging</code> with the following contents:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Packages/Extras/rc.imaging </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;h1&gt;!/bin/bash&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;/sbin/reboot
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>And make sure it&rsquo;s executable:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo chmod 755 Packages/Extras/rc.imaging
$ sudo chown root:wheel Packages/Extras/rc.imaging
</code></p>

<p>And now to make the NetInstall:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo ./AutoNBI.py -s /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app -f Packages -d ~/Desktop -n MyNetInstall -e
</code></p>

<p>The only change from last time is the <code>-f</code> option &ndash; this is the path to your <code>Packages</code> directory. I created my Packages directory in the same directory as AutoNBI.py &ndash; adjust the path if you made yours somewhere else.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2015-04-13/netboot.png"></p>

<p>You should now be able to boot off your tiny NBI (mine was 574MB) and have a bit of an explore. You&rsquo;ll notice that quite a bit is missing to achieve this tiny size &ndash; fortunately Pepijn has been working on getting Ruby and Python included in BaseSystem.dmg, so you have more scripting options when booted.</p>

    <link href="http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2015/04/12/building-custom-netinstalls-with-autonbi/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-12T20:33:28+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2015/04/12/building-custom-netinstalls-with-autonbi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another day, another tool made by <a href="http://enterprisemac.bruienne.com">Mr Bruienne</a>! A while back, Pepijn released <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bruienne/autonbi">AutoNBI</a> &ndash; a tool for automating the creation of NetInstall sets. At the time, it was filled away in the &ldquo;this is cool, but isn&rsquo;t this what System Image Utility does?&rdquo; section. Then I saw his NetInstall running at MacTech (are you seeing a theme here?). It had this really simple DeployStudio like imagaing app &ndash; it was really cool. And suddently it made sense why you can replace the <code>Packages</code> directory with AutoNBI &ndash; a NetInstall is a really stripped down OS X environment, so it it much easier to distribute and use &ndash; we&rsquo;re looking at around 1.8GB for my current NetInstall vs 5-6GB for a normal NetBoot.</p>

<p>This time we&rsquo;ll take a look at how to use AutoNBI to make a standard NetInstall &ndash; in a future post we&rsquo;ll look at some of the more cool things you can do with AutoNBI.</p>

<h2>Ok, stop talking, let&rsquo;s do this.</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to need AutoNBI to start off with. Open up your Terminal and:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/bruienne/autonbi.git
$ cd autonbi
</code></p>

<h2>Prepare the build!</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re ready to go (assuming you&rsquo;ve got an OS X installer &ndash; you do, right?). Still in your terminal:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo ./AutoNBI.py -s /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app -d ~/Desktop -n MyNetInstall -e
</code></p>

<p>What did we just do? The <code>-s</code> option is simply pointing at our Install OS X Yosemite.app &ndash; if you have it somewhere else, point AutoNBI there. <code>-d</code> is our destination directory and <code>-n</code> is the name of our NetInstall. <code>-e</code> is telling AutoNBI to make the NetInstall enabled.</p>

<p>So the next time there&rsquo;s a new OS X Installer, you can have an updated NetInstall in seconds, not minutes.</p>

    <link href="http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2015/02/11/managing-munki-catalogs-with-trello/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-11T12:11:30+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2015/02/11/managing-munki-catalogs-with-trello</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few months, I&rsquo;ve been trying to take small pieces of our workflow and see if we can expand on the number of people able to manage it. We&rsquo;ve got <a href="https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg">AutoPkg</a> populating our <a href="https://github.com/munki/munki">Munki</a> repositories without any manual intervention, but we still need to edit pkgsinfo files to move items through development to testing to production catalogs. Sure, there are existing tools  like <a href="https://github.com/munki/munkiwebadmin">MunkiWebAdmin</a> or <a href="https://github.com/hjuutilainen/munkiadmin">MunkiAdmin</a>, but they either still require knowledge of how Munki works or full access to the repository via a file share of some sort. And we obviously already have a tool for assigning software to machines in Sal+ &ndash; we needed something that can speed this incredibly common task.</p>

<p>Then I cast my mind back to a conversation I had with <a href="https://twitter.com/bruienne">Pepijn Bruienne</a> at PSU last year about his workflow using <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> to promote items in his Munki repository. So, after pestering him for some information, I devised a workflow that matched how we worked.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;So how does it work&rdquo;, I hear you cry</h2>

<p>We have five lists on our &ldquo;Munki Package Management&rdquo; Trello board. Essentially when the script runs, it inspects the items in our Munki catalog and if they&rsquo;re not already in the Trello board, it adds them to the correct list (we ignore anything that&rsquo;s already in production. All promotions to production are done using this tool now).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-02-11/to_testing.gif" width="427" height="240"></p>

<p>We also have lists called &ldquo;To Development&rdquo;, &ldquo;To Testing&rdquo; and &ldquo;To Production&rdquo;. Moving items into these lists will be caught by the script next time it runs, and moved to the appropriate catalog.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-02-11/testing.gif" width="427" height="240"></p>

<p>When items finally make it to Production, we add them to a dated Production list. This allows us to have a full history of when things are added to Production and who has moved it through each stage. We&rsquo;re also big users of Slack, so we hooked up it&rsquo;s Tello integration to post a message to our notficiations channel to let our team know when items are added into Munki.</p>

<p>You can grab the script from <a href="https://github.com/pebbleit/munki-trello">pebble.it&rsquo;s GitHub account</a>, or if you&rsquo;re Docker inclined there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/pebbleit/munki-trello/">container that has everything you need</a>.</p>
