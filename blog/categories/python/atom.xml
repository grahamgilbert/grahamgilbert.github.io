    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Obviously I&rsquo;m a little biased, but I love Sal. But, it can be a little tedious to get everything set up the first time if you have hundreds of Business Units and Machine Groups. I&rsquo;ve quietly ignored the problem for a while, but then I saw this tweet pop up in my feed:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hunty1er">@hunty1er</a> Pretty sure you could automate BU/MG creation through the DB backend. What say you <a href="https://twitter.com/grahamgilbert">@grahamgilbert</a> ?</p>&mdash; Pepijn Bruienne (@bruienne) <a href="https://twitter.com/bruienne/status/541811445512830976">December 8, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="http://grahamgilbert.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>What say I Mr Bruienne? Like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjB9Chw_6FE">man from Del Monte</a>, I say YES!</p>

<h2>The plan</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to use a few of the parts that make Django and Docker awesome. We will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a custom management command that will read in a CSV</li>
<li>The command will make the Business Units and Groups if they don&rsquo;t exist</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re than going to run it in a temporary Docker container when we&rsquo;re ready to do the actual import. This is one of the strengths of Docker &ndash; we can spin up a linked container that will operate on the main database, but won&rsquo;t interfere with your container serving the app.</li>
</ul>


<!--more-->


<h2>Let&rsquo;s do this thing</h2>

<p>Custom management commands are where you can add your own command to be available under <code>./manage.py my_command</code> &ndash; and they&rsquo;re pretty easy to make. I&rsquo;ve made a quick and dirty one (that works, but there will probbaly be edge cases where it doesn&rsquo;t).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re running Sal in the recommended way using Docker. If you&rsquo;re not, you can drop the management repo in <code>/path/to/sal/server/management</code>.</p>

<p>To use it, first you&rsquo;re going to need to clone the repository somewhere on your disk. I&rsquo;m going to assume you&rsquo;re working out of <code>/usr/local/docker</code>. There&rsquo;s an example CSV included in the repo.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ cd /usr/local/docker
$ git clone https://github.com/grahamgilbert/sal-import-example
</code></p>

<p>Next we&rsquo;re going to run a temporary Docker container on the same host that our existing Sal container is running on. This container will run the import, and when it&rsquo;s done it will delete itself (<code>--rm</code>). We&rsquo;ve linked in the import data and the additional management command. So we can see the output, we&rsquo;re running it in the foreground as well (<code>-i</code>). Finally, we run the custom management command and point it to the CSV.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ docker run -t -i -v /vagrant/sal/settings.py:/home/docker/sal/sal/settings.py \
  -e ADMIN_PASS=pass \
  -e DB_NAME=sal \
  -e DB_USER=admin \
  -e DB_PASS=password \
  --link postgres-sal:db \
  --rm \
  -v /vagrant/sal/management:/home/docker/sal/server/management \
  -v /vagrant/sal/data.csv:/data.csv \
  macadmins/sal \
  python /home/docker/sal/manage.py loadcsv /data.csv
</code></p>

<p>And you&rsquo;ll get the output reporting that your CSV did it&rsquo;s job:</p>

<p><code>bash
Omni Mega Corp didn't exist and has been created.
Machine Group 1 didn't exist and has been created.
Omni Mega Corp already exists.
Machine Group 2 didn't exist and has been created.
Honest Bob's Burgers didn't exist and has been created.
Machine Group 3 didn't exist and has been created.
</code></p>

<p>There it is &ndash; a simple management command to automate tasks with Sal and running it in a temporary Docker container. You can use the temporary container technique for many tasks &ndash; performing a <code>repo_sync</code> on a <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/macadmins/reposado/">Reposado container</a> is a good example.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems like Yosemite introduced an <a href="https://github.com/munki/createOSXinstallPkg#further-note-on-additional-packages-and-yosemite">undocumented change</a> that requires any packages that are added an OS X installer (e.g. Netinstall or createOSXinstallPkg) be distribution style packages, or you get a nasty failure acompanied by one of the most unhelpful error messages ever.</p>

<p>To fix this, <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/first-boot-pkg">first-boot-pkg</a> now builds distribution style packages.</p>

    <link href="http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2014/05/19/deploying-sal-on-heroku/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-19T09:04:05+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2014/05/19/deploying-sal-on-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Setting up everything you need for Sal can be difficult, especially if you only have an OS X server available. Thankfully, Sal is built on top of a very common Python framework, Django. And even more thankfully, you can run Django on a whole host of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a> providers, including <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.</p>

<p>Heroku has a very generous <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing">free tier</a> that will easily handle a small Sal installation, so let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<h2>Heroku toolbelt</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never used Heroku before, you&rsquo;re going to need to head over to <a href="http://heroku.com">their site</a> and sign up for a free account. Whilst you&rsquo;re there, you&rsquo;re also going to need to install their toolbelt. <a href="http://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/">Grab the package</a> and follow their instructions for linking it to your account.</p>

<h2>Configure</h2>

<p>Now we need to get a copy of Sal and configure it. Assuming you keep your code in ~/src:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ cd ~/src
$ git clone https://github.com/grahamgilbert/sal
$ cd sal
</code></p>

<p>Now we need to make a copy of sal/example_settings.py</p>

<p><code>bash
$ cp sal/example_settings.py sal/settings.py
</code></p>

<p>And edit sal/settings.py in your favourite editor to your liking (probably time zone at least).</p>

<p>Heroku uses git for deployment, so we need to commit our changes.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial commit to heroku"
</code></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re nearly there! Time to create our environment on Heroku</p>

<p><code>bash
$ heroku create
</code></p>

<p>Of course we haven&rsquo;t pushed Sal to Heroku yet. Let&rsquo;s fix that.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ git push heroku master
</code></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see Sal being pushed up to Heroku and Sal&rsquo;s requirements being installed. A Postgres database will also automatically be created for you. The database will be empty though, so let&rsquo;s populate it with what we need.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ heroku run python manage.py syncdb
</code></p>

<p>When asked, you certainly <em>do</em> want to create a super user. Use a strong username and password as this is the admin for your Sal application.</p>

<p>One last command to run:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ heroku run python manage.py migrate
</code></p>

<p>Your Sal installation is ready to use:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ heroku open
</code></p>

<p>As said earlier, the free version does have some limits. The most important with Sal is the number of rows you can have in the free database (10,000), so the more information you collect from each machine (Facter Facts and Munki Conditions), the larger your database is. It&rsquo;s a measley $9 a month to upgrade your database to 10 million rows, so it&rsquo;s easy to scale your database. For more information on upgrading your Heroku environment see <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/upgrade-heroku-postgres-with-pgbackups">their documentation</a>.</p>

    <id>http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2014/04/21/first-boot-pkg</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are some packages that can&rsquo;t be deployed to an unbooted OS, such as when building an image with AutoDMG. If you are using Greg Neagle&rsquo;s <a href="http://managingosx.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/son-of-installlion-pkg/">createOSXinstallPkg</a>, the OS X installer environment doesn&rsquo;t have everything a full OS X install has. For times like this, you need to install the packages at first boot. For a long time, I&rsquo;ve used Rich Trouton&rsquo;s <a href="http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2014/04/17/first-boot-package-install-revisited/">First Boot Package Install</a>, however I found myself repeating things quite a bit and having a folder full of first boot packages.</p>

<p>So, I made my own. The main features of <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/first-boot-pkg">first-boot-pkg</a> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is designed with scripting and automation in mind, with options able to be configured with a configuration plist or via options on the command line (or a mixture of both)</li>
<li>It will re-try failed packages a specified number of times (in case of Active Directory not being available, for example)</li>
<li>Will wait for the network to be available before installing (optional, can be disabled if desired just in case your package is going to let the Mac get onto the network)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;re happy with using Git, I&rsquo;d recommend just making a clone of the repository and doing a <code>git pull</code> to keep the script updated. If the thought of all those gits and pulls makes you run away, you can <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/first-boot-pkg/archive/master.zip">download a zip</a> of the project.</p>

<p>This script makes use of Per Olofsson&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/MagerValp/LoginLog">LoginLog</a> for displaying the log file whilst the script is running, so massive thanks to him for releasing it.</p>
