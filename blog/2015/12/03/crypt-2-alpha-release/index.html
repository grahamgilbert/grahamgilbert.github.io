  <h1 class="post-title">Crypt 2 Alpha Release</h1>
  <span class="post-date">03 Dec 2015</span>
  <p>A few months ago at PSU, Tom Burgin and Jeremy Baker <a href="https://youtu.be/tcmql5byA_I?list=PLRUboZUQxbyVydhdMcxGGfEaZc2sFdQk8">spoke about using Authorization Plugins</a>. I sat there watching this talk thinking about how cool it would be to use this method for Crypt. And then I had a go at it. And it was <em>hard</em>. So I put it to one side.</p>

<p>Then in November, I met up with Tom at MacTech. He very kindly donated a few hours of his time to get me started with re-writing Crypt as an authorization plugin in Swift. <!-- more --></p>

<p>Moving to an authorization plugin gives us a couple of advantages. The first is that this is the Apple-supported way of interacting with the machine before the user has completed login. Previously we had to use a Login Hook to launch things as the user was logging in if we wanted to run them as root - this has been deprecated for several releases of OS X, so it’s a good time to move off. Secondly, we get access to the user’s username and password, so it’s a more streamlined process when enabling FileVault not needing to ask the user to enter their credentials twice.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind this is an <strong>alpha</strong> release. You should not use this in production, but testing feedback is more than welcome. You can find out more on the <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/crypt2">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
