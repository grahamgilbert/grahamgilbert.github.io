  <h1 class="post-title">The future of Sal</h1>
  <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2015</span>
  <p>As some of you may know, yesterday was my last day at pebble.it. Since I announced I was leaving, I’ve been getting asked this pretty regularly, so I thought I’d answer it here.</p>

<p>My new job uses Munki extensively, and I expect to be using Sal there. As such, development of Sal will continue. I no longer have commit access to the Sal Software organisation, so I’ve forked the project and have set up <a href="https://github.com/salopensource">Sal Open Source</a> as an organisation on GitHub - hopefully this will be the last time anything needs to change. I’ll be moving the preference domain in version 0.4.0 of the client side scripts to <code>com.github.salopensource.sal</code> - once again, this should be the last time things need to change.</p>

<p>So, what else can you expect from Sal in the near future? The next release will have a GUI for managing your plugins, and I’ve started work on a basic API, which should make it easier for people to extend Sal in any language you like. For example, I’ve been working on a way to sign Puppet certificates based on whether it’s a known machine in Sal, with the machine being created via the API if it doesn’t already exist at imaging time (using Imagr, naturally).</p>

<p>It’s exciting times for users of all the projects I’m working on - in addition to these changes, I have some changes planned for <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Crypt">Crypt</a>, and of course <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr">Imagr</a> is still on the development rollercoaster.</p>
