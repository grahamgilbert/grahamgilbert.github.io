        Using the Sal API
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2015</span>


    
  <p>As previously mentioned, Sal now has an <a href="https://github.com/salopensource/sal/blob/master/docs/API.md">API</a>. You might be wondering what you can do with this wonderous API. This is a simple example of using it to automate building packages to enrol Macs into Sal.</p>

<p>The basic workflow of this script is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the API to get a list of all Machine Groups in Sal - this will return JSON (a markup language that is easily parsable with languages like Python)</li>
  <li>Download the Sal postflight scripts</li>
  <li>Download the latest Facter installer</li>
  <li>For each machine group, build a package that will install all of the packages and then set the correct Sal preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/grahamgilbert/8ccba318d3ecadee02b1">You can find the script in this Gist</a>. I’m not going to go through the script line by line, but we’ll cover how to configure it.</p>

<p>First off you will need an API key configuring. Log into Sal as a user with Global Admin privelages and choose the ‘person’ menu at the top right and then choose Settings. From the sidebar, choose API keys and then choose to make a new one. Give it a name so you can recognise it - I called this one “PKG Generator”. You will then be given a public key and a private key. Make a note of them, we’ll need them in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-the-script">Configuring the script</h2>

<p>Edit the variables at the top to match your environment:</p>

<figure class="code-highlight-figure"><div class="code-highlight"><pre class="code-highlight-pre"><div data-line="1" class="code-highlight-row numbered"><div class="code-highlight-line"><span class="c"># No trailing slash on this one - I was lazy and didn&#39;t check for it</span>
</div></div><div data-line="2" class="code-highlight-row numbered"><div class="code-highlight-line"><span class="n">SAL_URL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;https://sal.yourcompany.com&quot;</span>
</div></div><div data-line="3" class="code-highlight-row numbered"><div class="code-highlight-line"><span class="n">PUBLIC_KEY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;yourpublickeyhere&quot;</span>
</div></div><div data-line="4" class="code-highlight-row numbered"><div class="code-highlight-line"><span class="n">PRIVATE_KEY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;yourreallyreallyreallylongprivatekeyhere&quot;</span>
</div></div><div data-line="5" class="code-highlight-row numbered"><div class="code-highlight-line"><span class="n">PKG_IDENTIFIER</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;com.yourcompany.sal_enrol&quot;</span>
</div></div><div data-line="6" class="code-highlight-row numbered"><div class="code-highlight-line"><span class="n">SAL_PKG</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;https://github.com/salopensource/sal/releases/download/v0.4.0/sal_scripts.pkg&quot;</span>
</div></div><div data-line="7" class="code-highlight-row numbered"><div class="code-highlight-line"><span class="n">FACTER_PKG</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;https://downloads.puppetlabs.com/mac/facter-latest.dmg&quot;</span></div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>There are some caveats with this script:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It will spit the packages out in your current directory. Make sure you’ve <code>cd</code>-ed into where you want the packages to be generated.</li>
  <li>It uses <code>urllib2</code> to request the information from Sal and to download the packages - this means that there is no verification of the SSL certificates, so make sure you know where you’re connecting to.</li>
</ul>

<p>All ready to run it?</p>

<figure class="code-highlight-figure"><div class="code-highlight"><pre class="code-highlight-pre"><div data-line="1" class="code-highlight-row numbered"><div class="code-highlight-line"><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo python sal_package_generator.py</div></div></pre></div></figure>

<p>And you’ll get a directory full of packages that will get your fleet reporting into Sal.</p>

        Munki DND
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Jul 2015</span>


    
  <p>I’ve been wanting to get stuck in with a simple Swift project for a while, but couldn’t think of anything suitable for a first project (<a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr">Imagr</a> was originally going to be that project, but I don’t think it would ever have been made if I chose Swift), until I saw <a href="https://grpugh.wordpress.com/2015/07/03/a-do-not-disturb-application-for-munki/">Dr Graham R Pugh’s Do Not Disturb application</a>. I thought it was an excellent idea that could be made even better by being a manu bar app.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-07-07/active.png" /></p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/munki-dnd">Munki DND</a> - it extends Graham’s idea by allowing the administrator to configure the number of hours the user is allowed to suppress notifications for, as well as living in the menu bar so the user can check how long they’ve got until notifications become active again.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2015-07-07/disabled.png" /></p>

<p>You can grab version 0.0.1 of Munki DND from the <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/munki-dnd/releases/tag/v0.0.1">Releases page on GitHub</a>.</p>

        The future of Sal
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2015</span>


    
  <p>As some of you may know, yesterday was my last day at pebble.it. Since I announced I was leaving, I’ve been getting asked this pretty regularly, so I thought I’d answer it here.</p>

<p>My new job uses Munki extensively, and I expect to be using Sal there. As such, development of Sal will continue. I no longer have commit access to the Sal Software organisation, so I’ve forked the project and have set up <a href="https://github.com/salopensource">Sal Open Source</a> as an organisation on GitHub - hopefully this will be the last time anything needs to change. I’ll be moving the preference domain in version 0.4.0 of the client side scripts to <code>com.github.salopensource.sal</code> - once again, this should be the last time things need to change.</p>

<p>So, what else can you expect from Sal in the near future? The next release will have a GUI for managing your plugins, and I’ve started work on a basic API, which should make it easier for people to extend Sal in any language you like. For example, I’ve been working on a way to sign Puppet certificates based on whether it’s a known machine in Sal, with the machine being created via the API if it doesn’t already exist at imaging time (using Imagr, naturally).</p>

<p>It’s exciting times for users of all the projects I’m working on - in addition to these changes, I have some changes planned for <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Crypt">Crypt</a>, and of course <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr">Imagr</a> is still on the development rollercoaster.</p>

        Running Puppet Server in Docker Part 2: r10k
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jun 2015</span>


    
    <p>Last time we got our Puppet Server up and running - now we need to put some Puppet modules on it so we can use it.</p>

<p>To do that, we’re going to use r10k. It’s a tool that uses a control git repository that contains something called a puppetfile- a file that lists all of the puppet modules you want to use, either from the puppet forge or from git repositories. You may want to keep this module private by using a paid account on GitHub if your configuration contains secrets, but  it doesn’t have to be - mine doesn’t have anything particularly sensitive in, so here it is: <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/personal-puppet">grahamgilbert/personal-puppet</a>.

        Running Puppet Server in Docker
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Jun 2015</span>


    
    <p>Back when I started using Puppet, configuring a Puppet Master could be pretty tricky as there were several moving parts (it was a Rack application, so needed to run behind something like <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/">Passenger</a> if you had any number of clients). Thankfully, the new <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-server">Puppet Server</a> simplifies things massively - it’s just one installation to get things working in a way that would be suitable for putting straight into production.</p>

<p>Over the next few posts, I’ll take you through setting up the Puppet Server (running on Docker, naturally!), using r10k and git for managing your modules and using Hiera to configure your Macs - we’ll apply some configuration to a Mac without writing a single line of Puppet code .</p>

<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>

<p>You might well be thinking “why would I want to use Puppet?” After all, you’ve already got Munki. There are two main reasons I’ve chosen to go back to using a Puppet Server in conjunction with Munki.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s nice to have a fallback. If I manage to do something stupid and nuke my Munki install, or my customers manage to do the same, I’ve got some way of getting the machines back under control.</li>
  <li>“Free” SSL certs - this might not be a priority now, but it gives you an easy to to secure your Munki repository later on (which we may cover in a later post).
