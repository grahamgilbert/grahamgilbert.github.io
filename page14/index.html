        Using crankd to react to network events
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jul 2013</span>


    
    <p>Updated 14/7/2013: After <a href="https://twitter.com/Sacrilicious/status/355756510535614464">Alister’s suggestion</a>, the script now loops over network interfaces up to en19 (hopefully that’s enough!).</p>

<p>So, you’ve heard of this crankd thing, maybe even had a look at it, but have no idea how to get it going? You’re in the right place. I’m by no means an expert on it, having only been playing with it for less than a week, but I already have it running in production running the simple script below. My initial work, and therefore this post was inspired by Gary Larizza’s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120111031339/http://glarizza.posterous.com/using-crankd-to-react-to-network-events">two</a> <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2011/12/31/using-the-google-macops-crankd-and-facter-code/">articles</a> on the subject.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-crankd">What is crankd?</h2>

<p>It’s part of the <a href="https://github.com/acdha/pymacadmin">PyMacAdmin</a> set of tools that <a href="http://chris.improbable.org/">Chris Adams</a> and <a href="http://explanatorygap.net">Nigel Kersten</a> released a while ago. In a nutshell, it runs in the background via a LaunchDaemon and reacts to events on the Mac by running a script or a Python function, class or method. It has loads of events it knows about (application launches, power events, network events etc), but in this case I wanted to run something when there was a network change. Some of our machines never get turned off (and for some reason the Puppet Launch Daemon has crapped out), or aren’t turned on long enough for Puppet or Munki to run. I wanted a script that would run every time the machine came back onto the network, checking if there was an active connection and run Puppet and Munki.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-do">What do I need to do?</h2>

<p>There are a few parts that we need to bring together to make this work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The crankd.py executable and the supporting files</li>
  <li>A Launch Daemon to start the thing</li>
  <li>A preferences file to tell crankd what to do</li>
  <li>And finally, our custom code</li>
</ul>

  <p>For those of you who attended my talk yesterday at PSU MacAdmins on Managing Macs with Puppet, here are are my <a href="/images/posts/2013-05-24/Managing_Macs_with_Puppet.pdf">slides</a> and all of the code and servers used are up on <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/puppet_psu_2013">grahamgilbert/puppet_psu_2013 on GitHub</a>. Please comment, <a href="/about">email me</a> or catch me on the <a href="http://twitter.com/grahamgilbert">twitter</a> if you have any questions about any of this. Hopefully the video will be up soon, so those of you who weren’t there to laugh at the guy with the funny accent can see me dealing with internet fails and my obscure British sit-com references.</p>

        One bootstrap package to rule them all
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2013</span>


    
  <p>At work, we’ve recently changed how we build our bootstrap package to having the main code that connects a Mac to our Puppet infrastructure pulled down from GitHub when the client boots up for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>This might sound like madness to you. Why would anyone want to do this? We had two main issues to solve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I got sick of rebuilding our images every time our bootstrap script changed.</li>
  <li>Our engineers got sick of downloading the latest version of our package every time they thin / no-imaged a Mac.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why would our script change so much? In our case, it is to install the latest versions of Puppet and Facter. This isn’t strictly necessary, as we update Puppet and Facter with Munki, but occasionally there will be something in our Puppet config that requires a specific version - for example, when we started configuring usernames on 10.8 Macs with Puppet, the <code>salt</code> parameter was introduced. This required Puppet 3.0.2-ish or higher - which meant that any NetRestore image or old package that contained a version of Puppet lower than this would fail, and the engineer on site was in for a world of pain.</p>

<h2 id="ok-im-convinced">Ok, I’m convinced.</h2>

<p>I’ve put an <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/macscripts/tree/master/Puppet-Bootstrap">example up on GitHub</a>. This is a sanitised version of the bootstrap script we use at pebble.it. All we do in the script that gets deployed to the client is set the address of our Puppet server and then pull the rest of the script from GitHub - if you don’t need to set any variables, you could do all of the work in the remote script.</p>

<p>So this can be used with all of the deployment methods we use at pebble.it (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/instadmg/">imaging</a>, <a href="http://managingosx.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/son-of-installlion-pkg/">createOSXinstallPkg</a> and no imaging), we do the actual work in a script that is triggered by a launch daemon, so we can be sure we’re a) performing the work in a full OS X environment (we need Python to be available for our script) and that we’re running it on the boot volume of the client Mac (we need the serial number, and this could be installed via Target Disk Mode when no-imaging.</p>

<p>So when the bootstrap script needs to be updated, rather than rebuilding the package and distributing it to engineers and baking it into images, the workflow becomes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Update script, push to GitHub.</li>
  <li>Restore image with <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/macscripts/tree/master/Puppet-Bootstrap">puppet_bootstrap.pkg</a> baked in or install the package manually.</li>
  <li>Mac boots, downloads the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/macscripts/tree/master/Puppet-Install"><code>install_puppet.py</code></a>.</li>
  <li><code>install_puppet.py</code> downloads and installs the correct versions of Puppet and Facter and configures Puppet.</li>
  <li>Puppet downloads, installs and configures Munki along with all of the other configuration.</li>
  <li>PROFIT</li>
</ol>

<p>This clearly isn’t required or suitable for all types of script - but if you have a package that is frequently updated and you have staff installing it by hand, this is a relatively simple way to make sure they’ve got the latest version at all times.</p>

    <p>Facter is what gives Puppet it’s brains. It collects information about the computer it is run on and then passes it to the Puppet Master for use in manifests and can optionally be stored. I know, it doesn’t sound like the most earth shattering revelation of all time, but stop for a moment. Every time your current scripts need to taget a specific OS version or a machine with a certain bit of hardware, you need to code it directly into the script. If the method of extracting that information changes, you need to modify every single script that uses that method. With Facter, you’re editing one file, which is always up to date on the client. Anyway, that’s enough waffle from me. Let’s get started.

    <p>We’ve made quite a bit of progress with our Puppet install. We’ve already made Puppet do something useful with setting up an admin user, but let’s get back to being lazy - let’s get someone else to write the code.</p>

<p>Before reading this post, you really need to read <a href="http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2013/01/25/getting-started-with-puppet-part-1/">part 1</a>, <a href="http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2013/01/27/getting-started-with-puppet-on-os-x-part-2/">part 2</a> and <a href="http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2013/02/24/getting-started-with-puppet-on-os-x-part-3/">part 3</a> of the series.</p>

<p>Modules are little pre-built bits of Puppet code. They’re a good example of Puppet’s philosophy of convention over configuration - Puppet will assume your modules follow a set pattern. We’ll be using two of the available folders in modules today: files and manifests. Files are static files that Puppet will copy over to our client machine, and manifests will contain the Puppet code we’ve previously been putting into <code>/etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp</code> - whilst it’s been easy to put code into this file, it can become unwieldy when you have a few nodes to manage.</p>

<p>There are also loads of pre-built modules on the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/">Puppet Forge</a> - it’s one of these modules we’ll be using today.
