        The agony and ecstasy of 100meg broadband

    <p>Before I descend into a massive rant, let me preface this post with this: I hate BT. I always have, and I probably always will. They are generally the most incompetent, uncooperative company on the planet.</p>

<p>Let me take you back to October 2011. I was perusing the BT website looking for BT Infinity - their brand name for up to 40meg VDSL. I popped in my postcode and was told that I was in a trial area for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x#Fiber_to_the_premises">FTTP</a> at a stonking 100meg. Obviously I thought about the pain I was letting myself in for, having to deal with BT, but I was sure that I could cope with it if I was getting such insanely fast Internet at the end of it.</p>

<p>If only I knew how painful it was going to be.

  <p>I’ve pushed some updates to this script, mainly switching to using <a href="https://github.com/unixorn/luggage">The Luggage</a> for making the package. As ever, it’s up on <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Make-Recovery-HD">Github</a>.</p>

  <p>So you’ve lovingly crafted your never booted image in InstaDMG. It’s fully up to date and lovely. And then you try to enable FileVault 2. As you have no Recovery HD, it’s not going to happen.</p>

<p>I’ve tried several methods to get around this, including taking an image of an existing Recovery HD. It worked (ish), but didn’t feel right. Then I found this post on <a href="https://plus.google.com/113021614344742332063/posts/8D8FJjps5C6">google +</a>. I’ve lovingly ripped off the method and put it into a package for deployment with DeployStudio, ARD, or anything else that can take normal packages. <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/Make-Recovery-HD">You can download everything from my GitHub</a>, usage instructions are in the readme.</p>

        Web server on Linode part 1
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jan 2012</span>


    
    <p>Recently, I was tasked with moving a client’s web server from a box in their office, to something a little more robust when they put something up there that caused the server to go nuts (30 mb/s nuts!).</p>

<p>The main goals were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fast, scalable web server</li>
  <li>Multiple FTP users for the client’s web team to modify the site</li>
  <li>Integrates with their existing CrashPlan PROe backup system.</li>
  <li>Use GUI’s as much as possible for admin so lower level techs could make changes on the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>After considering several options, we decided to go with Linode. I’ve had great success hosting my own site with them, and as we had full access to the box, we could install anything we wanted - including CrashPlan.

        Thoughts on Profile Manager
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Dec 2011</span>


    
  <p>We’ve been using a 10.7 Server in the office since Lion was released, but it is only now that I’m about to install an all Lion office, so will get the chance to use Profile Manager in a real install. Over the last few months, I’ve noticed a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t bother using a self signed SSL certificate. Preferences will fail to push seemingly at random without a proper certificate. For what they cost, get over to Godaddy and buy yourself a cheap certificate and save yourself hours of head scratching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On first glance, Profile Manager seems to be lacking load of options that we had in Workgroup Manager. Remember that your can upload your own plists, so we can still set all of the options that we could before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve not been able to set Mobility preferences using Profile Manager, so have had to fall back to MCX for this as the client mac steadfastly refuses to use the settings I’ve set in Profile Manager. If anyone has any ideas about this, I’d love to hear them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re using DeployStudio, your can cut out a load of post imaging faffing about with enrolling the mac by using an Enrolment Profile and then using the workflow item in DS to get the client talking to your server.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
