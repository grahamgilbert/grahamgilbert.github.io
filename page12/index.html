        ZNC: An IRC Bouncer
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Oct 2013</span>
    
            <p>Yes,  it’s true. The most interesting conversations in the Mac admin world take place using technology from the 1980’s - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> (##osx-server on <a href="http://freenode.net/">freenode</a>). Those of you who know me will know that I’m borderline OCD. In this instance, my major annoyance was that I’d only get half of the conversation and I’d miss private messages when I had to put my laptop to sleep. I needed to somehow keep a persistient conenction to IRC without having to sit infront of my computer 24/7.</p>

<p>I’d heard of IRC bouncers before - an app that runs on a server, saving the messages in the rooms you specify for you until you are able to read them, but always assumed they were much more difficult to set up than it turned out to be.</p>

<p>This is set up on a box running Ubuntu 12.04, with port 6666 opened on your firewall and forwarded to the box if you want to access it from outside the network. Mine is running on an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">Amazon EC2 Micro instance</a> - available for free for one year if you don’t already have a server to run it on.</p>

<p>Right, let’s get started. All of these commands are to be run as your normal user (<code>graham</code> in this case - <strong>not root</strong>). First we’re going to enable backports in Ubuntu. I like editing text files in <code>nano</code> so I’m going to install that first, but feel free to use Vi or whatever you like.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y nano
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></p>

<p>Find the two backports lines commented out (lines 44-45 on my test box) and unomment them.</p>

<p><code>bash
deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-backports main restricted universe multiverse
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-backports main restricted universe multiverse
</code></p>

<p>If you are using nano, hit <code>CTRL+O</code> and press return to save it, then <code>CTRL-X</code> to exit.</p>

<p>To install ZNC, issue the following command:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y znc/precise-backports znc-dbg/precise-backports znc-dev/precise-backports znc-extra/precise-backports znc-perl/precise-backports znc-python/precise-backports znc-tcl/precise-backports
</code></p>

        Creating an OS X base box for Vagrant with Packer
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2013</span>
    
            <p>A while ago, the chaps over at the <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> project have recently released a <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware">plugin to let Vagrant work with VMWare Fusion</a> - this means we can finally use Vagrant to provision OS X VMs.</p>

<p>Why is this a good thing? Do you NetBoot VMWare to test your builds? Or maybe you still have that test Mac on your desk to test your builds. Either way, it’s going to be several minutes to restore an image, even if you’re thin imaging. With the VM already on your machine, you’re ready to go in seconds. Another bonus is that Vagrant isn’t only limited to OS X virtual machines - for example, I have a Vagrant configuration that spins up an Ubuntu box configured as a Munki server, with a copy of my repository on an external drive. This allows me to test deployments from anywhere, with everything local to my Mac (have you ever tried testing a Final Cut Studio package from home? 48GB takes a while to download.). I’ll go into more detail on this setup in a future post, but for now here’s how to get a Mac base box into Vagrant.</p>

        The Luggage: Further automation

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2013</span>
    
            <p>As promised in my previous post, today we’re going to look at how we can further refine our workflow, with the aim of cutting out as many manual steps as possible (every IT person knows it’s not computer that make mistakes, it’s the idiots in front of them) and making as much of our code re-usable in other packages.</p>

<p>If you’ve not read the <a href="http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2013/08/09/the-luggage-an-introduction/">previous article</a>, you will need to before carrying on with this, unless you’re already familiar with The Luggage. If you get stuck, all of the code from this post is <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/the-luggage-post-201308">up on Github</a>.</p>

        The Luggage: An Introduction
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2013</span>
    
            <p>If you’ve managed OS X for any amount of time, chances are you’ve needed to deploy software. And chances also are that you’ve come across a vendor (I’m looking at you, Adobe) that seems to be incapable of distributing their software in a useful manner. Or maybe you’ve got your own scripts or software that you need to get installed on the machines that you look after - either way, you’re going to want to build a package.</p>

<p>You’ve got a few options - Iceberg, Packages, Composer, you’ve even got Package Maker. However, my personal choice is The Luggage. It has a few advantages over the alternatives:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It’s all text files:</strong> You’re building software distributions, you should be checking the files in to build the packages into version control, such as Git. Text files are ideal for checking into version control.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s free:</strong> if it costs nothing, there’s no reason it can’t be installed on everyone’s machine.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s (still) all text files:</strong> Want to see what will be in the package without any extra work? Crack open the Makefile and you can see straight away what will be in the package.</li>
  <li><strong>The Luggage has a metric buttload of shortcuts built in:</strong> it does the hard work, so you don’t have to.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s repeatable:</strong> Have you ever tried to talk someone through a series of windows and buttons to get the same result as you’re getting? Every time you run The Luggage, you will get the same result.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s (really, still) all text files:</strong> It’s the most precise tool I’ve used - you only package exactly what you need, no cruft is left behind.</li>
  <li><strong>Your workflow is limited only by your imagination:</strong> Seriously, you can do pretty much anything you can think of. We’ll be going through more advanced workflows in future posts, but let’s get started with using The Luggage.</li>
</ul>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2013</span>
    
            <p>In my <a href="http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2013/07/12/using-crankd-to-react-to-network-events/">last post</a> I promised a tool I’ve been working on to automate the building of a package for crankd.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/buildCrankPkg">buildCrankPkg</a> is a small script that will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pull down the latest version of crankd (or use a local or remote repository if you specify one)</li>
  <li>Build a package that includes crankd and your custom settings and scripts.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve included two examples, one that implements calling Munki and Puppet as detailed in the last post, and one to run a Casper policy.</p>

<p>If you’re happy with what crankd does and using the command line, head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/buildCrankPkg">repository</a> and enjoy. If you need a bit more help to get started, read on.</p>
