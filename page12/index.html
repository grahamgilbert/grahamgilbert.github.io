        The Luggage: An Introduction
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2013</span>
    
            <p>If you’ve managed OS X for any amount of time, chances are you’ve needed to deploy software. And chances also are that you’ve come across a vendor (I’m looking at you, Adobe) that seems to be incapable of distributing their software in a useful manner. Or maybe you’ve got your own scripts or software that you need to get installed on the machines that you look after - either way, you’re going to want to build a package.</p>

<p>You’ve got a few options - Iceberg, Packages, Composer, you’ve even got Package Maker. However, my personal choice is The Luggage. It has a few advantages over the alternatives:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It’s all text files:</strong> You’re building software distributions, you should be checking the files in to build the packages into version control, such as Git. Text files are ideal for checking into version control.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s free:</strong> if it costs nothing, there’s no reason it can’t be installed on everyone’s machine.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s (still) all text files:</strong> Want to see what will be in the package without any extra work? Crack open the Makefile and you can see straight away what will be in the package.</li>
  <li><strong>The Luggage has a metric buttload of shortcuts built in:</strong> it does the hard work, so you don’t have to.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s repeatable:</strong> Have you ever tried to talk someone through a series of windows and buttons to get the same result as you’re getting? Every time you run The Luggage, you will get the same result.</li>
  <li><strong>It’s (really, still) all text files:</strong> It’s the most precise tool I’ve used - you only package exactly what you need, no cruft is left behind.</li>
  <li><strong>Your workflow is limited only by your imagination:</strong> Seriously, you can do pretty much anything you can think of. We’ll be going through more advanced workflows in future posts, but let’s get started with using The Luggage.</li>
</ul>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2013</span>
    
            <p>In my <a href="http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2013/07/12/using-crankd-to-react-to-network-events/">last post</a> I promised a tool I’ve been working on to automate the building of a package for crankd.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/buildCrankPkg">buildCrankPkg</a> is a small script that will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pull down the latest version of crankd (or use a local or remote repository if you specify one)</li>
  <li>Build a package that includes crankd and your custom settings and scripts.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve included two examples, one that implements calling Munki and Puppet as detailed in the last post, and one to run a Casper policy.</p>

<p>If you’re happy with what crankd does and using the command line, head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/buildCrankPkg">repository</a> and enjoy. If you need a bit more help to get started, read on.</p>

        Using crankd to react to network events
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jul 2013</span>
    
            <p>Updated 14/7/2013: After <a href="https://twitter.com/Sacrilicious/status/355756510535614464">Alister’s suggestion</a>, the script now loops over network interfaces up to en19 (hopefully that’s enough!).</p>

<p>So, you’ve heard of this crankd thing, maybe even had a look at it, but have no idea how to get it going? You’re in the right place. I’m by no means an expert on it, having only been playing with it for less than a week, but I already have it running in production running the simple script below. My initial work, and therefore this post was inspired by Gary Larizza’s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120111031339/http://glarizza.posterous.com/using-crankd-to-react-to-network-events">two</a> <a href="http://garylarizza.com/blog/2011/12/31/using-the-google-macops-crankd-and-facter-code/">articles</a> on the subject.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-crankd">What is crankd?</h2>

<p>It’s part of the <a href="https://github.com/acdha/pymacadmin">PyMacAdmin</a> set of tools that <a href="http://chris.improbable.org/">Chris Adams</a> and <a href="http://explanatorygap.net">Nigel Kersten</a> released a while ago. In a nutshell, it runs in the background via a LaunchDaemon and reacts to events on the Mac by running a script or a Python function, class or method. It has loads of events it knows about (application launches, power events, network events etc), but in this case I wanted to run something when there was a network change. Some of our machines never get turned off (and for some reason the Puppet Launch Daemon has crapped out), or aren’t turned on long enough for Puppet or Munki to run. I wanted a script that would run every time the machine came back onto the network, checking if there was an active connection and run Puppet and Munki.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-do">What do I need to do?</h2>

<p>There are a few parts that we need to bring together to make this work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The crankd.py executable and the supporting files</li>
  <li>A Launch Daemon to start the thing</li>
  <li>A preferences file to tell crankd what to do</li>
  <li>And finally, our custom code</li>
</ul>

        One bootstrap package to rule them all
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2013</span>
    
            <p>At work, we’ve recently changed how we build our bootstrap package to having the main code that connects a Mac to our Puppet infrastructure pulled down from GitHub when the client boots up for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>This might sound like madness to you. Why would anyone want to do this? We had two main issues to solve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I got sick of rebuilding our images every time our bootstrap script changed.</li>
  <li>Our engineers got sick of downloading the latest version of our package every time they thin / no-imaged a Mac.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why would our script change so much? In our case, it is to install the latest versions of Puppet and Facter. This isn’t strictly necessary, as we update Puppet and Facter with Munki, but occasionally there will be something in our Puppet config that requires a specific version - for example, when we started configuring usernames on 10.8 Macs with Puppet, the <code>salt</code> parameter was introduced. This required Puppet 3.0.2-ish or higher - which meant that any NetRestore image or old package that contained a version of Puppet lower than this would fail, and the engineer on site was in for a world of pain.</p>

<h2 id="ok-im-convinced">Ok, I’m convinced.</h2>

<p>I’ve put an <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/macscripts/tree/master/Puppet-Bootstrap">example up on GitHub</a>. This is a sanitised version of the bootstrap script we use at pebble.it. All we do in the script that gets deployed to the client is set the address of our Puppet server and then pull the rest of the script from GitHub - if you don’t need to set any variables, you could do all of the work in the remote script.</p>

<p>So this can be used with all of the deployment methods we use at pebble.it (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/instadmg/">imaging</a>, <a href="http://managingosx.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/son-of-installlion-pkg/">createOSXinstallPkg</a> and no imaging), we do the actual work in a script that is triggered by a launch daemon, so we can be sure we’re a) performing the work in a full OS X environment (we need Python to be available for our script) and that we’re running it on the boot volume of the client Mac (we need the serial number, and this could be installed via Target Disk Mode when no-imaging.</p>

<p>So when the bootstrap script needs to be updated, rather than rebuilding the package and distributing it to engineers and baking it into images, the workflow becomes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Update script, push to GitHub.</li>
  <li>Restore image with <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/macscripts/tree/master/Puppet-Bootstrap">puppet_bootstrap.pkg</a> baked in or install the package manually.</li>
  <li>Mac boots, downloads the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/macscripts/tree/master/Puppet-Install"><code>install_puppet.py</code></a>.</li>
  <li><code>install_puppet.py</code> downloads and installs the correct versions of Puppet and Facter and configures Puppet.</li>
  <li>Puppet downloads, installs and configures Munki along with all of the other configuration.</li>
  <li>PROFIT</li>
</ol>

<p>This clearly isn’t required or suitable for all types of script - but if you have a package that is frequently updated and you have staff installing it by hand, this is a relatively simple way to make sure they’ve got the latest version at all times.</p>
