        Updating InstaDMG based NetRestore images
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2013</span>
    
            <p>This probably isn’t news to anyone else, but I made a discovery last week that will save me a fair bit of time.</p>

<p>Whilst staring at System Image Utility after yet another change to the build, I thought that there must be a better way of doing this, bearing in mind that the basic InstaDMG process is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install the OS</li>
  <li>Install Packages</li>
  <li><strong>Make a read-only DMG</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Prep the DMG for ASR</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>And SIU’s process is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Make a read-only DMG</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Prep the DMG for ASR</strong></li>
  <li>Copy it into a writable disk image with a stripped down OS to restore the image.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, two steps are duplicated. This inefficiency must be stopped!</p>

<p>After a 30 second hunt in the NetInstall.dmg file that SIU spits out, I saw a file called System.dmg in the Packages folder - sure enough, it was my InstaDMG image. I replaced it with my new build, and it worked flawlessly.</p>

<p>If your new image is larger than the one you’re replacing, you just need to expand the NetInstall.dmg image to a size large enough to accomodate the new image.</p>

<pre><code>hdiutil resize -growonly -size 15g /path/to/your/NetRestore.nbi/NetInstall.dmg
</code></pre>

<p>Replace the 15g with whatever size you want, 15 GB was plenty to accomodate my updated image.</p>

        InstaDMG Tips
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2013</span>
    
            <p>I’ve been using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/instadmg/">InstaDMG</a> for nearly two years now. We all know it’s awesome (if you aren’t aware of it’s awesomeness, I suggest taking a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8xtO5E4MzE">Allister Banks’ talk at PSU MacAdmins last year</a>). I’m almost ashamed to admit that I was happily making my Golden Master images on my test iMac and hoping for the best when I cleaned them up by hand and pushed them out. Anyway, that’s enough of my admissions. Over these two years, I’ve picked up a few tips and tricks for working effectively with InstaDMG.</p>

<h2 id="put-an-ssd-in-your-laptop">Put an SSD in your laptop</h2>
<p>Seriously, just do it. If your boss complains at how much it costs, then they’re not charging enough for you. The price of the SSD was covered by the time I saved when doing one particularly chunky build (around 30GB including packages). InstaDMG is primarily I/O bound, so an SSD will change your InstaDMG life.</p>

<h2 id="keep-your-instaup2datepackages-on-a-web-server">Keep your InstaUp2DatePackages on a web server</h2>
<p>If you’ve got more than one person building images in your organisation, you’ll soon find that your packages will get out of sync with each other. One person will be using 0.8.2 of Munki, another 0.8.3, it all goes horribly wrong. As InstaDMG can pull packages from a web server, this lends itself to having a central repository for packages in your oganisation. Remember to keep it safely behind your firewall if you’ve got sensitive info in your packages (like one that creates your admin user, for example).</p>

<h2 id="keep-our-catalogfiles-in-source-control">Keep our CatalogFiles in source control</h2>
<p>Now that everyone has access to your InstaUp2DatePackages, we ought to get our CatalogFiles in check too. Keep them in some sort of source control like <a href="http://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2012/09/21/five-reasons-sysadmins-should-use-git/">Git</a> and be happy. Mine can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/InstaDMG-Catalogs">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <p>I’ve had my Mac scripts dotted around my Macs over the years, so after spending twenty minutes looking for my script to add a login item to a user, I decided to put them all in one place on GitHub. Hopefully someone will find them useful, I’ll be adding the rest as soon as I work out where I put them.</p>

        Casper versus DeployStudio
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Dec 2012</span>
    
            <p>I’ll preface this with one thing - I’m not a Casper Suite expert. I don’t use it reguarly, and at what it costs, I probably won’t! It’s this price that gave me high expectations for this last install. Unfortunately they were unfounded.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to write a series of articles comparing the various aspects of Casper against the free tools I use every day. First up is DeployStudio.</p>

<h2 id="workflow-creation">Workflow creation</h2>
<p>Both Casper Imaging and DeployStudio have a nice GUI for creating the workflow. It’s just a drag and drop to place the tasks you need. The DeployStudio interface feels a bit more polished, but that’s probably just my bias showing though. The only real differentiator here are the package groups that DeployStudio offers. If you had a standard group of packages that you deploy over several different workflows, DeployStudio makes it easy to maintain - yes, this should probably be done elsewhere, but it can be handy to install a certain set of applications at imaging time. I couldn’t see a direct replacement for this in Casper Imaging.</p>

<p><strong>Winner: Draw (just! if pushed, I’d say DeployStudio just edged it)</strong></p>

<h2 id="netboot">NetBoot</h2>
<p>This is where DeployStudio really starts to poop on Casper Imaging from a great height. With Casper, the chap doing the jump start told me that I had to manually build up a NetBoot image with Casper Imaging set up. Hilarious. Surely he was joking, right? No. DeployStudio, a <em>free product</em>, has a wizard for making a customised NetBoot set that offers an iTunes like interface that is so simple, I’ve regularly taken an office manager through imaging a Mac. I dread to think how that same person would cope with the random UI elements that have been thrown at the screen when making the casper imaging app.</p>

<p><strong>Winner: DeployStudio, hands down. Casper didn’t even turn up</strong></p>

<h2 id="imaging-process">Imaging process</h2>
<p>So, you’ve managed to get past the lovely Casper Imaging interface, and now you’re installing a package that’s best installed when running from the target system - like an Adobe CS package. One that is likely to be the biggest package you’re installing. With DeployStudio, you at least get some indication that <em>something</em> is happening - you have the log scrolling by in the background. With Casper Imaging you get nothing other than a back window, and the nice Casper logo. No idea if it’s going to take five minutes or two hours.</p>

<p><strong>Winner: DeployStudio</strong></p>

<p>I’ll finish this post with an admission: I don’t use DeployStudio either. I’ve been trying to get rid of OS X in my server rooms, so as I mentioned in my last post, we’re using JAMF’s NetSUS appliance (dear JAMF, why can you make an awesome free product like NetSUS, but your flagship product be so poor?) and NetRestore with a InstaDMG made image with just an OS and a package to hook it into Puppet. I chose to compare Casper Imaging with DeployStudio as they’re closer competitors than the one trick pony of NetRestore.</p>

    <span class="post-date">12 Dec 2012</span>
    
            <p>A few months ago, we decided to move away from DeployStudio for imaging our Macs to reduce the OS X footprint in the server room (a plain old NetRestore can be run from <a href="https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/viewProduct.html?id=180&amp;view=info">NetSUS</a>). This left us with a problem - how are we going to name our Macs now (a task previously performed by DeployStudio)?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/grahamgilbert/macnamer">MacNamer</a>. It’s usage and installation is detailled in the Readme file, please fork, try to break, file pull requests. This has been in production for several months at work, but I’m sure someone will manage to make it break!</p>
